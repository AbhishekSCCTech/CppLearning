## Problem Definition
Implement a C++ program to dynamically allocate an integer array using `malloc`. The program allows the user to specify the size at runtime and input values into the array. Functions are provided to add, remove, and display elements.

## Solution
- A class `DynamicArray` is defined to encapsulate dynamic array operations.
- The array is allocated using `malloc` and freed using `free`.
- Methods are provided for adding, removing, and displaying elements.

## Learning
- Dynamic memory management using `malloc` and `free` in C++.
- Encapsulating array operations within a class for cleaner code and reusability.

## Output
Example output:
