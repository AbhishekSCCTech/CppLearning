## Problem Definition
Implement a class named `Vector` to demonstrate operator overloading in C++. The class should support vector addition and dot product operations.

## Solution
The `Vector` class has two overloaded operators:
- The `+` operator to add two vectors.
- The `*` operator to calculate the dot product of two vectors.

## Learning
Operator overloading allows us to define how operators behave for user-defined types, enhancing code readability and functionality.

## Output
