# Dynamic Array Implementation

## Problem Definition
Implement a dynamic array class that allows users to add, remove, and access elements. Use `new` and `delete` for memory management.

## Solution
The dynamic array class manages its own memory using `new` for allocation and `delete` for deallocation. It dynamically resizes when the capacity is exceeded.

## Learning
Understanding dynamic memory management in C++ is essential for efficient resource management. This implementation highlights the importance of manual memory management.

## Output
