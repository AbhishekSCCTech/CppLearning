# Dynamic Allocation with Constructor

## Problem Definition
Create a class `Student` that allocates an array of grades dynamically in the constructor and deallocates it in the destructor.

## Solution
The `Student` class has private attributes for storing grades and their size. The constructor dynamically allocates memory for the grades, while the destructor ensures that memory is freed when the object goes out of scope. Methods are provided to set and display grades.

## Learning
This implementation demonstrates dynamic memory management in C++ using constructors and destructors, emphasizing the importance of resource management.

## Output
