# Problem Definition
Implement a class called `Account` with private attributes for account number and balance. Provide public methods to set and get these values while keeping the attributes private.

# Solution
A simple `Account` class is created with private members for `accountNumber` and `balance`. Public methods are provided to set and retrieve these values.

# Learning
This implementation demonstrates the use of access specifiers in C++. It shows how to encapsulate data within a class and control access to that data through public methods.

# Output
