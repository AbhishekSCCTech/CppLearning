# Sum of Natural Numbers with Recursive Function

## Problem Definition
Implement a C++ program that calculates the sum of the first **n** natural numbers using a recursive function. The program prompts the user for input and validates that **n** is a positive integer. It displays the result along with the recursive call count.

## Solution
The solution involves a class `NaturalNumberSum` with a recursive method `sum(int n)`, which calculates the sum of natural numbers up to **n**. A member variable `callCount` tracks the number of recursive calls made during execution.

## Learning
This program demonstrates:
- The use of recursion in C++.
- Input validation for user-provided data.
- Basic object-oriented programming concepts by encapsulating functionality in a class.
- condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
