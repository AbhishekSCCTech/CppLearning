## Problem Definition
Binary Search Implementation: Write a C++ program to implement Binary Search to find an element in a sorted array. It should handle cases where the element is present or absent.

## Solution
- A simple class-based approach to encapsulate the binary search logic.
- The array is sorted using std::sort from the Standard Library.
- The binary search function returns true if the element is found and false otherwise.ts.

## Learning
- Implementation of binary search in a sorted array.
- Understanding of basic algorithm logic and condition handling.

## Output
Example output:
