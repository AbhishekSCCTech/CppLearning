# Function Overloading Example

## Problem Definition
Implement a series of overloaded functions named `printValue` that can handle different data types (int, double, and string). The goal is to demonstrate how C++ resolves these function calls based on the argument types.

## Solution
The program uses a class named `Printer` with three overloaded methods of `printValue`. Each method handles a different data type, showcasing C++'s ability to resolve function calls based on the types of arguments passed.

## Learning
- Understanding function overloading in C++.
- Observing how C++ differentiates functions based on parameter types.
- Implementing simple class-based designs in C++.
